    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add peppercorns to a zippered food storage bag and seal. Lightly pound with a meat mallet or skillet until peppercorns are broken and cracked. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter to a 12-inch nonstick skillet set over medium heat.  Heat until the butter is melted and no longer bubbling. Swirl the pan to combine oil and butter.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt and add to the skillet. Cook chicken on both sides until lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Clean skillet with paper towels, return to the burner, and add remaining butter and shallot. Cook, stirring, until butter melts and shallot is softened, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in broth, heavy cream, thyme, and cracked peppercorns. Cook, stirring, and bring to a boil.  Make sure to stir up any browned bits into the sauce from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and any juices from the plate. Return to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Plate chicken on top of rice, on 4 plates. Turn the heat back to medium and cook until sauce thickens and darkens a bit, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and spoon sauce over chicken. Garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
